# Test Interface Updates - Completed ✅

## Changes Made:

### Server-side (project/server/index.js)
- [x] Changed question limit from 10 to 30 in `/api/questions/:category/:subcategory` route
- [x] Line 427: `.limit(10)` → `.limit(30)`

### Client-side (project/src/components/Student/TestInterface.tsx)
- [x] Changed initial time limit from 15 minutes to 30 minutes
- [x] Line 21: `useState(15 * 60)` → `useState(30 * 60)`
- [x] Changed time calculation in handleSubmit function
- [x] Line 25: `(15 * 60) - timeLeft` → `(30 * 60) - timeLeft`

## Features Implemented:
- ✅ 30 questions per test (previously 10)
- ✅ 30-minute time limit (previously 15 minutes)
- ✅ Questions are already shuffled on the server side (existing functionality)

## Notes:
- The server already shuffles both the questions and their options before sending to the client
- No additional changes needed for question shuffling as it was already implemented
- The changes affect both the number of questions fetched and the time allowed for the test
